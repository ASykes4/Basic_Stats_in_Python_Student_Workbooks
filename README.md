# Basic Stats in Python Student Workbooks

This repository contains the workbooks that you'll use for demonstration and exercises for Akeem's stat's class. To get started with this repository:
<ul>
<li> Click the green "Code" button towards the upper right of the page. 
<li> Use the copy button (the button beside the text) to copy the HTTPS link. It should be the default. 
<li> In VS Code, click the "Source Control" button on the side toolbar. 
<li> Select "Clone Repository" and place your link in the tool bar. 
</ul>

Throughout the class we'll generally work through exercises in these workbooks. Akeem will update and tweak them as the term goes depending on what exactly we end up focusing on. To get the updates, before each class it is advisable to "pull" the updates down from the central server. To do so:
<ul>
<li> In VS Code, with the repository open, click the source control button on the sidebar. 
<li> In the Souce Control column, click the 3 dots to expand the menu. 
<li> Select "Pull" from the menu. Click OK/Yes if there are any pop-ups. 
</ul>
Doing this pull will update your copy with any changes made to the source documents, this is part of the magic of version control! Get EXCITED!!
